# debian-qtile-install

### Usage: `./installscript.sh <username to make a sudoer>`


NOTE:
This script is an untested prototype and will change.
I will be installing a blank install of Debian and updating this script as I go, so that I can take a raw clean install of debian and set up all of my configs and applications on any new device.
